# Predictions

## Description

This project focuses on implementing a Kalman filter to make predictions based on given datasets. The primary objective is to provide an efficient and accurate method for data prediction and error analysis. This tool is designed for researchers, engineers, and anyone interested in data prediction techniques.

## Installation Instructions

To set up the "Predictions" environment, follow these steps. Ensure you have Python installed on your system before proceeding.

1. **Create a new virtual environment**:

   ```shell
   python -m venv predenv
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   
   On Windows:
   ```shell
   .\predenv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   
   On macOS and Linux:
   ```shell
   source predenv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install required packages**:

   Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file in your project directory. Run the following command to install the necessary packages:
   
   ```shell
   pip install -r .\requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage Instructions

Once the installation is complete, you are ready to run the Kalman filter and analyze the error in predictions.

- **Run the Kalman filter**:

  ```shell
  python .\eval.py
  ```

- **Generate the error plot**:

  ```shell
  python .\Errorcalc.py
  ```

These commands will execute the Kalman filter on your dataset and produce an error plot based on the predictions, helping you understand the accuracy and efficiency of the predictions.
